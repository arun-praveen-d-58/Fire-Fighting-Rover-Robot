I have created a Fire Fighting Robot, the mechanism used for locomotion is called Rocker-Bogie mechanism that are been used in designing Mars rovers.I have tried my level best to make it a multi-disciplinary project.Since this is just a prototype, it's a cost efficient one.

Parts used:
1.Arduino UNO - Arduino UNO is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P. It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz ceramic resonator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller.

2.L293D Motor driver - The L293D IC receives signals from the microprocessor and transmits the relative signal to the motors. It has two voltage pins, one of which is used to draw current for the working of the L293D and the other is used to apply voltage to the motors.

3.Lipo batteries 2200 MAH - A lithium-ion battery or Li-ion battery is a type of rechargeable battery composed of cells in which lithium ions move from the negative electrode through an electrolyte to the positive electrode during discharge and back when charging. Li-ion cells use an intercalated lithium compound as the material at the positive electrode and typically graphite at the negative electrode.

4.12v geraed DC motors x 6 - This 12 Volt DC Motor â€“ 100 RPM can be used in all-terrain robots and a variety of robotic applications. 

5.PVC pipes - 2 x 18 cm
              4 x 14 cm
              6 x 10 cm
6.Micro Servo Motor SG90  - It runs on electricity from a battery and spins at high RPM (rotations per minute) and very low torque.

7.Flame sensor - A flame detector is a type of sensor that can detect and respond to the presence of a flame. These detectors have the ability to identify smokeless liquid and smoke that can create open fire.

8.12v submersible DC pump - DC powered pumps use direct current from motor, battery, or solar power to move fluid in a variety of ways.

9.HC-05 Bluetooth Module - It  is an easy to use Bluetooth SPP (Serial Port Protocol) module, designed for transparent wireless serial connection setup. Its communication is via serial communication which makes an easy way to interface with controller or PC.

10.Plastic wheels x 6 

Methodology:
First of all the chasis is built completely using PVC pipes.
