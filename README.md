# Fire Fighting Rover Robot
â€ƒ&emsp; I have created a Fire Fighting Robot, the mechanism used for locomotion is called Rocker-Bogie mechanism that are been used in designing Mars rovers.It can climb over the obstacles using this mechanism. I have tried my level best to make it a multi-disciplinary project. Since this is just a prototype, it's a cost efficient one. It uses Flame sensors to detect fire and uses water pump to spray water over fire prone areas.

## Parts used:

  + Arduino UNO 

  + L293D Motor driver 

  + Lipo batteries 2200 MAH 

  + 12v geared DC motors  x  6 

  + PVC pipes - 2 x 18 cm,
                4 x 14 cm,
                6 x 10 cm
              
  + Micro Servo Motor SG90 

  + Flame sensor 

  + 12v submersible DC pump 

  + HC-05 Bluetooth Module 

  + Plastic wheels  x  6 

## Methodology:

  â€ƒ&emsp; <p>First of all the chasis is built completely using PVC pipes.The dimensions of the sectioned PVC's are given below schematically.</p>

   &emsp; <p>The motors were mounted the sectioned PVC's are mounted using clamps and bolts, and the individually sectioned PVC's are connected together using couplings with specified diameter as the PVC's.</p> <br />

   &emsp; <p>A pair of leg-span is assembled with the help of nuts and bolts, each leg-span consits of six legs that are held together using fixed as well as movable links.Both the leg-span is connected together with the help of a square shaped assembled PVC section, on which the plastic board is held that holds all the electronic hardware part.The images of assembled prototype is shown below ðŸ‘‡</p> <br />

   &emsp; <p>I have built a mobile app using MIT App Inventor, by which the robot works automatically also can be controlled manually, to blow of the flame by spraying water, whenever the flame is detected. The UI of the app is shown below ðŸ‘‡</p> <br />
