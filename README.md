I have created a Fire Fighting Robot, the mechanism used for locomotion is called Rocker-Bogie mechanism that are been used in designing Mars rovers.I have tried my level best to make it a multi-disciplinary project.Since this is just a prototype, it's a cost efficient one.

Parts used:

  1.Arduino UNO 

  2.L293D Motor driver 

  3.Lipo batteries 2200 MAH 

  4.12v geared DC motors  x  6 

  5.PVC pipes - 2 x 18 cm,
                4 x 14 cm,
                6 x 10 cm
              
  6.Micro Servo Motor SG90 

  7.Flame sensor 

  8.12v submersible DC pump 

  9.HC-05 Bluetooth Module 

  10.Plastic wheels  x  6 

Methodology:

  First of all the chasis is built completely using PVC pipes.
