# Fire Fighting Rover Robot
â€ƒ&emsp; I have created a Fire Fighting Robot, the mechanism used for locomotion is called Rocker-Bogie mechanism that are been used in designing Mars rovers.I have tried my level best to make it a multi-disciplinary project. Since this is just a prototype, it's a cost efficient one.

## Parts used:

  + Arduino UNO 

  + L293D Motor driver 

  + Lipo batteries 2200 MAH 

  + 12v geared DC motors  x  6 

  + PVC pipes - 2 x 18 cm,
                4 x 14 cm,
                6 x 10 cm
              
  + Micro Servo Motor SG90 

  + Flame sensor 

  + 12v submersible DC pump 

  + HC-05 Bluetooth Module 

  + Plastic wheels  x  6 

## Methodology:

  â€ƒ&emsp; <p>First of all the chasis is built completely using PVC pipes.The dimensions of the sectioned PVC's are given below schematically.</p>

   &emsp; <p>The motors were mounted the sectioned PVC's are mounted using clamps and bolts, and the individually sectioned PVC's are connected together using couplings with specified diameter as the PVC's.</p> <br />

   &emsp; <p>A pair of leg-span is assembled with the help of nuts and bolts, each leg-span consits of six legs that are held together using fixed as well as movable links.Both the leg-span is connected together with the help of a square shaped assembled PVC section, on which the plastic board is held that holds all the electronic hardware part.  </p> <br />
